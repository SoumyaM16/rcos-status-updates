Last Week's Accomplishments:
I made new GitHub repository of my own so I could use it to test on and lear Node.js. I used node.js and express to make a simple server locally hosted in which I just displayed a basic message of Hello and attempted to create a button.

This Week's Plan
To learn angular and HTML to make the website more than a simple outline.

Anything Blocking?
Sick last week but better now.
