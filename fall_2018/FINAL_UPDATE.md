Overall Accomplishments:

So although I did not work on many issues in this project, I learned a lot ovver the course of the semester. I started with some very basic knowledge in javascript, and little to no knonwledge about MongoDB, angular, and databases.
It took a fairly long time, and a lot of trial and error with installing the necessary dependencies. I had to make my own personal repository to learn how to locally host a webpage. I faced many issues when trying to use webpack that required attention from trying to use webpack to locally host the personal repository
I have a fairly good understanding of how venue works as a project and have understood most of the code base, especially the code that displays the grid like fashion of the events.
My issue was to work on the list view of the events, and I had issues after working on my priate repository that locally hosted a website with a menu and buttons.

Some difficulties:
I had many issues with dependencies, to the point were gulp serve refused to locally host, and every single babel dependency had to be installed to the node folder. The node folder is hidden and though doing an installation of the dependencies included in the venue project. 
I also had issues with webpack when trying to make my own project, to learn how to locally host a site. It would work with just node but when trying to use webpack, there were errors, and it refused to host.
