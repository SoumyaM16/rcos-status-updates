Last Week's Accomplishments: I worked on how to create a dropdown menu from a button for all the courses. I was not sure where in the venue code I would add this so, I made a drop down menu on my own repository and tested it on a locally hosted server.

This Week's Plan: To make the list view rather than a drop down menu.

Anything Blocking? I misundderstood how we want to display the list view of the courses. Rather than a drop down menu from a button, it should be a separate view once the uer clicks on a button to show the courses in list view.

Notes This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
