Last Week's Accomplishments went through the Mean Stack Tutorial: Angular, Node/Express, Webpack, MongoDB, SASS, Babel/ES6, Bootstrap 

This Week's Plan To work on an assignment/issue for venue with a list of courses unlike the grid of blocks with course descriptions.  

Anything Blocking? I went through the tutorial and was having issues with getting the weback dev server to work. I thought it could be with the way i installed it (globally/locally) so I uninstalled and re installed several times, but still had errors. Part of the problem was that the tutorial was dated and some functions in the example code were deprecated, but I changed said functions to the most recent versions but stil cmd was giving me issues with getting the webpack server to work. I could get the local one to workk but for some unknown reason webpack would not.
