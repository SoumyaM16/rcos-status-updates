Last Week's Accomplishments: Presented on Friday. Started working on my first issue of making a list like view of all the courses that are in a grid like fashion with descriptions. I went through the client folder to try to figure out where I should make a file with the alternative courseview. I also am currently trying to figure out where in the code the names of the course and the department of each course are stored

This Week's Plan To continue working on the issue I was assigned.

Anything Blocking? Lack of familarity with the existing code, and a few tests this week. 

Notes This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
